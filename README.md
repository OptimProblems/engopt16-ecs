## Content

This repository provides Matlab/Octave and Python implementations of
the ECS model presented in:

Paul Feliot, Yves Le Guennec, Julien Bect and Emmanuel Vazquez (2017).  
Design of a commercial aircraft environment control system using
Bayesian optimization techniques.  
In: _EngOpt 2016, 5th International Conference on Engineering Optimization_, pp. 400-409.


## Authors

The Matlab/Octave code was written by Paul Feliot (IRT SystemX), based
on earlier work carried out by Cl√©ment Coras (IRT SystemX) during his
master internship under the supervision of Michel Fouquemberg (Airbus).

The Python code was adapted from the Matlab/Octave code by Yves Le
Guennec (IRT SystemX).
